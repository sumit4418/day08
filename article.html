            <p style="width: 65%; float: left; padding=10px; text-decoration: lightskyblue;">MUMBAI: The south-west monsoon arrived in Mumbai and its neighbouring areas on Wednesday, the IMD announced as heavy rains lashed the city and suburbs since early morning, causing water-logging at many places and disrupting local train services.
                The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a red alert for Mumbai, and neighbouring Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts, warning of very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places there during the day.
                "As per latest satellite observations, Mumbai city and suburbs are very likely to experience moderate to intense spells of rainfall (2-3cm/hr) during next 3-4 hrs. Possibility of thunder lightning at isolated places," the IMD Mumbai said in its forecast at 2.30pm.
                The city and its suburbs experienced thunderstorms along with moderate to intense spells of rainfall during the past 3 hours, it added.
                Local train services from Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji MaharajTerminus (CSMT) to neighbouring Thane and Vashi in Navi Mumbai were suspended due to water-logging on some railway tracks, officials said.</p>
